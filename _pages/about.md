About Me
======
I am currently a management graduate after completing my civil engineering degree in 2017 at the University of Nottingham specialising in project management and structures. Upon working in supervision and management, I discovered a love for data and its analysis. This also sparked my general interest in technology and innovation which lead me to Data Science.

I am currently working to leverage my mathematical acumen from engineering and my involvement with data from management to continually improve my data science portfolio in machine learning, data visualisation and deep learning.
