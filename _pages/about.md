About Me
======
I am currently a Royal Mail Management graduate after completing my Civil Engineering degree in the University of Nottingham (2017) specialising in project management and structures. Upon working in supervision and management, I discovered a love for data and its analysis. This also sparked my general interest in technology and innovation which lead me to Data Science.]

I am currently working to leverage my mathematical acumen from engineering and my involment with data from management to continually improve my data scienece portfolio in machine learning, data visualistion and deep learning.
