## Summary
This was my first ever ML project and although it took almost 3 weeks I gained a very in depth and almost intuitive understanding of the SciKit Learn API. I was able to get train a model to +80% cross validaton accuracy but did not get an overall accuracy score as this was not included in the dataset. That will be my next focus for my next poject. 

I am still learning more and more about ML algorightms and the overall stats and linear algebra used and hopefully this is the first of many projects.

The project code can be found on GitHub through the link below.
