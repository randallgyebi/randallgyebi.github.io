I am currently working on my first dedicated machine Learning Project which is the Titanic Dataset. In all honesty, the development has taken a bit longer that I have anticipted. The transition from theory to practicwe hasnt been as seamlessly as hoped but the notebook and post should be up and ready my 07 April 2019.
