Yesterday was my third machine learning meetup at ["Learn Machine Learning Workshop"](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-machine-learning-london/). I attended their second meetup at Just Eat and this was fourth event being held at CompareTheMarket. (![alt text](/images/comparethemarket.jpg))

## Talk by Cedric (Data Scientist, CompareTheMarket)
We recieved a talk from Cedric, a data scientist at CompareThe Market who spoke on the ML pipeline and the use of AWS for storing and utilising models.

## ML Challenge
We then went on to a challenge for developing a model for predicting the labels on [this dataset](https://github.com/abitravers1989/machine_learning_challenge/tree/master). The data was already clean with 30 binary attributes and 3o normalised continuous attributes.
All in all, it was a good experience and I was able to meet people trying to make the same career transition I am embarking on.

The project code can be found on GitHub through the link below.
