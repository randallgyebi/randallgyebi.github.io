### Night Shifts & Fitness
I was having a good streak of fitness, having been to the gym 6 days a week for more than a month but I have stopped this chain 
willingly as I have started night shifts.
The change in sleep cycles alone will affect my microbiome so avoiding stress will give my body the recovery it needs to cope 
with the change. I've taken this as an opportunity to deload and hopefully I will be able to get back into routine by Sunday.
