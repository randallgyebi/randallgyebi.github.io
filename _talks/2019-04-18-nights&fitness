### Night Shifts & Fitness
I was having a good streak of fitness, having been to the gym 6 days a week for the past month but I have broken that chain 
willingly as I have started night shifts.
The change in sleep cycles alone will affect my microbiome so I am trying to avoid stress and give my body the recovery it 
will need to cope with the change. I've taken this as an opportunity to deload and hopefully I will be able to get back into routine by Sunday.
