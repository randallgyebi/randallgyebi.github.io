### Solid Routine
I'm in a very good routine with my fitness routine now. Its been almost 5 weeks of 6 days a week training. The routine per week is:
- 2 x Fullbody Workout
- 2 x Distance Training
- 2 x Swimming Session

My dad was there to spot at my last workout session. I hate how he makes me look small. ðŸ˜†

## Barbell Math
When people think of the hardest topics in mathematics, they usually think calculus or geometry. To me barbell
math is just about confuses me everytime especially on the bench. Im not particularly sure if the blood rush is partly to 
blame but dividing 77.5kg on an Olympic barbell isnt as intuitive as you'd think. 

20kg + 20kg +20kg + 5kg +5kg +2.5kg +2.5kg + 1.25kg + 1.25kg

Its very simple in writing but for some reason I have ended up doing more weight than intended from time to time
