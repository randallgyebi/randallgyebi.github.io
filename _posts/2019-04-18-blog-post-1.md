### Chapter 4 & 5 of Hands On ML: COMPLETE 
Although I already have a good understanding of regression and SVMs I just deepened my knowledge of them after finishing <a href="https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/04_training_linear_models.ipynb" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a> & <a href="https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/05_support_vector_machines.ipynb" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>. I still need to polish my understanding of the kernels for SVMs but I should be able to implement the linear and rbf kernels to great effect.

The Regression chapter covered many topics including: 
i) Linear Regression  ii) Gradient Descent  iii) Polynomial Regression  iv) Learning Curves  v) Regularised Models  vi) Logistic Regression

The SVM chapter covered many topics including:
i) Linear Classification (Soft & Hard Margins)  ii) Nonlinear Classification iii) SVM Regression

My next plan of action will be to apply this in the project in progress below.

## Work In Progress: Auto MPG
While watching a video of a Google Data Scientist, he mentioned a dataset he likes to give to aspirant: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg" target="_blank">Auto MPG dataset</a>.

The Auto MPG is a dataset from the UCI repository with an associated task of regressions. With 398 instances and 8 features the data is quite small and it was donated by Carnegie Mellon University in 1993. The goal is to predict the MPG of a vehicle given the attributes.
