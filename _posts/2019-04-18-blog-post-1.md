### Chapter 4 & 5 of Hands On ML: COMPLETE 
I guess the next stage will be to apply the theory in a progect and that is my next plan of action.

## Work In Progress: Auto MPG

## Talk by Cedric (Data Scientist, CompareTheMarket)
We recieved a talk from Cedric, a data scientist at CompareThe Market who spoke on the ML pipeline and the use of AWS for storing and utilising models with S3.

## ML Challenge
We then went on to a challenge for developing a model for predicting the labels on  <a href="https://github.com/abitravers1989/machine_learning_challenge/tree/master" target="_blank">this dataset</a>. The data was already clean with 30 binary attributes and 30 normalised continuous attributes.


The project code can be found on GitHub through the link below.
