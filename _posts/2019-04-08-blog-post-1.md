I recently finished a comprehensive course in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/home/welcome" target="_blank">SQL for Data Science</a> by UC Davis .
The course was one of the better courses that I done and the contents were quite relevant. The final project was a bit lacking though as it did not
require utilising all the techniques that leverage relational data as it was shown in the lecture. 
I did sure quite well on it however and Im quite proud of that.
