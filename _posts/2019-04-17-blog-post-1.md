Yesterday was my third machine learning meetup at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Learn-machine-learning-london/" target="_blank">Learn Machine Learning Workshop</a>.I attended their second meetup at Just Eat and this was their fourth event being held at CompareTheMarket.

## Talk by Cedric (Data Scientist, CompareTheMarket)
We recieved a talk from Cedric, a data scientist at CompareThe Market who spoke on the ML pipeline and the use of AWS for storing and utilising models with S3.

## ML Challenge
We then went on to a challenge for developing a model for predicting the labels on  <a href="https://github.com/abitravers1989/machine_learning_challenge/tree/master" target="_blank">this dataset</a>. The data was already clean with 30 binary attributes and 30 normalised continuous attributes.
All in all, it was a good experience and I was able to meet people trying to make the same career transition I am embarking on.

The project code can be found on GitHub through the link below.
