# My Journey So Far
My journey into data science, and computer science in general, started in November 2018. It all started after a simple YouTube video about machine learning [training a game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX2Hyu5WoFg). It used what I now know is reinforced learning to improve the results over many iterations but the notion of a computer learning to become proficient on its own was mind blowing.

## My Past With CS
I was good at Maths and Physics but also had a passion for Art, so to reconcile all these I reasoned my way into Civil Engineering at the University of Nottingham. [alt text][/imaes/graduation.jpg]
I would soon realise that you can't logic your way into passion and I was partial through the degree. I did however have a C Programming module in my first semester of university. Although I got a 99% on the exam, somehow it didn't click that computer science or software engineering was a path I could have taken. I briefly got into Javascript for app development but thought it would be too complicated to figure out. Hindsight has revealed that I quite enjoy the theory and practice of CS a lot and I have decided to explore this on my own by self teaching with MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy and other sources on YouTube 

## Learning The Basics & Python
I decided to learn quite a bit of the basics along with Python and started absorbing anything I could.
### November 2018
I first bought a highly recommended book by the Python community, Learn Python The Hard Way (LPTHW). I thought the title was quite tongue in check but it was indeed quite barebones and to the point which I actually appreciated. The very  first chapter had me working in the terminal using command prompt, something I hadn't done since  university and reignited my interest in CS as a whole. I decided to bolster my fundamentals and watched [CrashCourse CS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsliXzRnE_IvL7Tvxyt9cQs0IlvCDFMU1) which started from NAND to C and my physics background helped greatly in understanding most of the principles.

### December 2018
I started practicing simple coding challenges on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) just to practice the application to help the concepts settle in. I then pip installed and started using the NumPy and Pandas libraries.

I was smooth sailing through LPTHW until I hit Chapter 41... **Object Oriented Programming**. Till this day I’m still learning more on how this works but it helped to realise that almost everything in Python is an object and the only why to understand OOP is to experience it will coding.

It wasn’t until I went back to using NumPy and Pandas that the principles of OOP suddenly clicked and I could see it all over Python. I went back and realised that even dictionaries and other fundamental data types where objects and the functions like add() and pop() were just in-build functions of the class. Mindblow.

It was also at this point that I started my learning of Data Structures & Algorithms. I started watching the [MIT OpenCourseWare videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) although I am still only half way and will need to implement most of the algorithms to gain true insight. 

### January 2019
January was a slow start but I bought Python Data Science Handbook and that was my primary reading that month. It’s very informative but quite slow and I’ve come to realise that it’s more of a reference book than a tutorial type companion. The little insights into how NumPy and Pandas worked was invaluable though. I didn’t make much progress this month however due to an increase in work.

I did however start following an outline for [learning data science in 3 months](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Data_Science_in_3_Months) but learning data science part time cannot be done in 3 months. The general outline of things to cover have been helpful however.

I also learnt about [version control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) and git just so I could get around and read good code when I could.

### February 2019
I come across some posts about getting into CS and being self taught and I used that to shape my learning as well. I finished the Khan Academy Stats course and skipped the Probability as the course laid more emphasis on Stats (I should probably go back and finish that). I also finished an eDx course for [Computing for Data Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computing-for-data-analysis) by Georgia Tech. Upon finishing I was quite disappointed because although I learnt some useful concepts like Regex, the course was not very involved and left me with no real applicable skills. It was around this time that I started taking [IBMs courses on Data Science](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/) too, which have proven quite entertaining and practical. Ill be doing more of those instead.


### March 2019
I bought the best resource I have used till date, Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and TensorFlow. The only downside is I haven’t had as much time to read it as I wish and I’ll have to make more time to read up on it as it will aid in making projects for my portfolio.



### The Future
Whether I stay as a manager in Royal Mail or venture into a data science career ultimately, I believe data science will be a great tool on my belt. I read an [article by Eric Schmidt](https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2018/december/eric-schmidt-told-us-what-managers-should-really-focus-on-in-2019) talking about how effect managers of the future will leverage the power of AI and I completely agree. I just hope I manage to combine the technical aspect of machine learning with the human side of interacting with people as my career progresses.
